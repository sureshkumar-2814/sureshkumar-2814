## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Suresh Kumar!

Product Engineer by day, Problem Solver by nature â€” blending CAD Automation, Data Analytics, and AI to build Smart, Scalable APIs.

## What I Do

- Develop CAD plugins (Rhino, C#, Python) used by 50+ users across 4 regions â€” saving 250+ hours per collection
- Analyze sales + design data to uncover patterns and drive better product decisions
- Build ML models and chatbots â€” from clustering design images to detecting patterns in trading data
- Lead mini-teams, streamline workflows, and deploy auto-updating systems with zero downtime

## Projects You'll Find Here
- `nifty-engulfing-detect`: Real-time script that detects bullish engulfing patterns using Kite Connect
- `used-car-sales-sql-analysis`: Data analyst case study using only SQL. Investigated trends in pricing, manufacturer stats, and model-based insights using a Kaggle dataset.
- `flask-user-api`: A lightweight RESTful API using Flask that securely handles user record creation, retrieval, and deletion with hashed phone numbers and input validations.
- Geometry scripts, optimization tools, and generative AI experiments (abstracted for confidentiality)
